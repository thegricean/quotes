# The Undoing Project (Michael Lewis)

- p. 0 "'Doubt is not a pleasant condition, but certainty is an absurd one.' -- Voltaire"

- p. 31 "He suggested a new definition of the nerd: a person who knows his own mind well enough to mistrust it."

- p. 72 "[...] psychology was a noisy dinner party during which the guests talked past one another and changed the subject with bewildering frequency. The Gestalt psychologists and the behaviorists and the psychoanalysts might all be jammed into the same building with a plaque on the front that said Department of Psychology, but they didn't waste a lot of time listening to one another. Psychology wasn't like physics, or even economics. It lacked a single persuasive theory to organize itself around, or even an agreed-upon set of rules for discussion. Its leading figures could, and did, say of the work of other psychologists, *Basically, what you are doing and saying is total bullshit*, without any discernible effect on the behavior of those psychologists."

- p. 72 "Part of the problem was the wild diversity of the people who wanted to be psychologists -- a rattle-bag of characters with motives that ranged from the urge to rationalize their own unhappiness, to a conviction that they had deep insights into human nature but lacked the literary power to write a decent novel, to a need for a market for their math skills after they'd been found inadequate by the physics department, to a simple desire to help people in pain."

- p. 248 "How would you even persuade some important decision maker to assign numbers to his 'utilities'? Important people didn't want their gut feelings pinned down, even by themselves."

- p. 265 "'The absence of definite information converning the outcomes of actions one has not taken is probably the single most important factor that keeps regret in life within tolerable bounds [...] We can never be absolutely sure that we would have been happier had we chosen another profession or another spouse... Thus, we are often protected from painful knowledge concerning the quality of our decisions.'"
