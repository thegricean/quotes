# Train robbery (Peter Cook and Alan Bennett)

- wrong interpretation of functional relation between constituents of compound nouns:  
   "A: Good evening. I'm going to ask you just a few questions about the train robbery.  
   P: Good evening. Well, I'd like to make one thing quite clear at the outset. When you speak of a train robbery, this in fact involved no loss of train."

- under-informative reply:  
   "A: Who do you think may have perpetrated this awful crime?  
   P: We believe this to be the work of thieves."

- sense ambiguity of "responsible":  
   "A: So you feel that thieves are responsible?  
   P: Good heavens no, I feel that thieves are totally irresponsible, ghastly people who go around snatching our money."

- sense ambiguity of "appreciate":  
   "A: Well I certainly appreciate that, sir.  
   P: You may appreciate that, but most people don't."

- metonymy interpreted literally (failure of deferred reference).  
   "A: Isn't that where you piece together the face of the criminal?  
   P: Not entirely, no. We're only able to piece together the appearance of the face of the criminal."
