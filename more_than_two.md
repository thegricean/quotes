# More Than Two -- A practical guide to ethical polyamory (Franklin Veaux and Eve Rickert

## Chapter 2 -- Many forms of love

- p. 31 Is there a "right" number of partners to have to be poly? No. Is there a "right" number for *you* to have? Maybe. There is certainly some maximum. There is a saying among poly people: "Love is infinite; time and attention are not." [...] Different people have different constraints on the time and attention they can offer, and different relationships require different amounts, so some people can maintain more romantic relationships than others before they become, as the term goes, "polysaturated".

## Chapter 3 -- Ethical polyamory

- p. 39 For each person, the "right" way to do poly is to talk about your needs, fears, and insecurities; to talk about the ways your partner can support you; and to honor your commitments -- without being controlling or placing rules on other people to protect you from your own emotional triggers. Above all else, trust that you don't have to control your partner, because your partner, given the freedom to do anything, will want to cherish and support you. And always, always, move in the direction of greatest courage, toward the best possible version of yourself.

- p. 43 Being able to share, to the best of your ability, who you are in a relationship is critical for that relationship to be consensual. You must give your partner the opportunity to make an informed decision to be in a relationship with you. If you lie or withhold critical information, you remove your partner's ability to consent to be in the relationship. 

- p. 44 It's especially important to communicate things that might be deal-breakers, or might be threatening to your partner's emotional or physical health. [...] You cannot force someone to make the choice you want them to make, and if you lie or withhold information, you deny them the ability to know that there was a choice to be made.

## Chapter 4 -- Tending yourself

- p. 52 Learning to understand and express your needs, learning to take responsibility for your emotions... that's hard work.

- p. 53 Nosce te ipsum. Know thyself. You can't have what you want if you don't know what you want. You can't build a relationship that's satisfying without first understanding yourself and your needs. A willingness to question yourself, to challenge yourself, and to explore without fear the hidden parts of you are the best tools to gain self-knowledge. [...] "Your true self can be known only by systematic experimentation, and controlled only by being known." Understanding and programming your mind is your responsibility; if you fail to do this, the world will do it for you.

- p. 55 becoming the kind of person who can live those [poly] ideals is a never-ending process. [...] Understanding where you are *right now* is just as important. That includes understanding whether you are ready to share a partner or to be shared. The problem with being idealists about polyamory is that we risk putting ourselves into situations we're not ready for. If we do that, we risk hurting other people.

- p. 55 Although self-awareness is important, so is self-compassion. We don't look inward so we can pass judgment on all our flaws. We do it so we can be aware of how our behavior is aligning with our values, what effect we're having on other people, how we may be sabotaging ourselves and our relationships. Understand where you are, yes, but also understand that it's ok to be there, at least for now.

## Chapter 5 -- Nurturing your relationships

- p. 80 Flexibility promotes resilience. It helps create relationships that can adapt to the winds of change without breaking. It has a cost, though. Being flexible means being willing to face discomfort, because change is often uncomfortable. [...] There is more to life than avoiding discomfort. Sometimes discomfort is an inevitable part of learning and growth. [...] When avoidance of discomfort comes at the cost of placing controls on other people, we disempower those people.

- p. 83 A lack of boundaries is not the same thing as compassion, nor is letting someone walk all over us, or overlooking poor behavior or mistreatment of others. Real compassion requires strong boundaries, because if we are letting someone take advantage of us, it becomes very hard to be authentically vulnerable to them. Compassion requires a willingness to hold other people accountable for what they *do*, while accepting them for who they *are*.

- p. 83 How do we practice compassion? The cornerstone of compassion is simple, but emotionally difficult to achieve. It means, first and foremost, assuming good intent from others. In other words, looking for the most charitable interpretation of someone else's deepest motives.

- p. 85 The skill of expectation management means [...] recognizing that a desire on my part does not constitute an obligation on your part. And we can never reasonably be upset at anyone for failing to live up to our expectations if we haven't talked about our expectations in the first place.

## Chapter 6 -- Communication pitfalls

- p. 103 Open communication means exposing yourself to rejection or judgment or trouble. It may mean finding out that what you assumed your lover thinks and feels is wrong. It presents the possibility of hearing no to your deepest wishes, and it may mean having your needs or desires turned against you if the relationship is unhealthy. There is no communication -- at least not meaningful communication -- without vulnerability.

- p. 103 Almost always, communication tends to be most difficult precisely when it's most important. [...] If you're afraid to say it, that means you need to say it.

- p. 104 We can't expect others to respect our boundaries and limits if we don't talk about them or, worse, pretend they don't exist. 

- p. 104 Coercion happens any time you make the consequences of saying no so great that you've removed reasonable choice.

## Chapter 7 -- Communcation strategies

- p. 113 If you say yes to everything, then your yes might or might not be sincere, and your partner ends up trying to read tea leaves to figure out if you mean it or not. If you don't want to do something, you may become resentful when you do it, even if you said yes to it. Conversely, when you are able to say no and your partner knows it, they know your yes is genuine.

- p. 113 Consistently asking for waht you need means people can trust you to ask. They don't have to be second-guessing themselves, reading between the lines, or worrying about you.

## Chapter 8 -- Taming the green-eyed monster

- p. 126 A common trigger for jealousy is seeing your partner being physically affectionate or flirty with someone else. This can bring up fears of being replaced or activate the "Why am I not enought?" script. It can also lead to destructive comparison with your partner's other partner. [...] Sometimes all it takes to deal with these triggers is to recognize the feelings for what they are and say, "I am feeling jealous because it seems like I'm learning to understand I'm not your only partner. Please bear with me while I work through this."

- p. 130 When we transfer responsibility for our emotions to others, we yield control over our own lives.

- p. 130 It's okay to feel jealous.

- p. 135 Long-lasting jealousy management can come only from strengthening the places where your self-esteem is weak. [...] Almost always, jealousy is rooted in some sort of fear: of abandonment, of being replaced, of losing the attention of someone you love, of being alone. Jealousy isn't really about the person you feel jealous of. It's about you: your feeling that you might lose something precious. What is it saying? What's the outcome you're afraid will happen?
Getting to the roots of your jealousy takes time. When you feel jealous, you often want to act on it immediately -- usually in destructive ways. Instead, take the time to figure out what's actually going on, what your jealousy is trying to tell you.

## Chapter 9 -- Boundaries

- p. 150 The difference between "boundaries we set for ourselves" and "rules we place on someone else" [...] is profound. *Rules* tend to come from the idea that it's acceptable, or even desirable, for you to control someone else's behavior, or for someone else to control yours. *Boundaries* derive from the idea that the only person you really control is yourself.

- p. 150 If you constantly seek reinforcement of your worth from your partner, your partner becomes your source of worth, rather than your equal. This kind of codependence is exhausting for your partner and destructive for you.
This is especially likely to happen if you have trouble setting boundaries. Fuzzy boundaries can lead to a loss of self-identity and an inability to tell where your self [...] ends and your partner begins.

- p. 157 Healthy boundaries need flexibility. They can't be so brittle that the slightest touch threatens to end a relationship. There must be some allowance for the fact that we are all born of frailty and error. We need to be able to accept a certain amount of push, and reassert our boundaries by pushing gently back. We need to be able to say, "Hey, I would prefer you not do this thing," rather than "You monster! How dare you!"

## Chapter 10 -- Rules and agreements

- p. 169 You have to trust that your partners want to take care of you -- that given the freedom to do whatever they choose, they will make choices that respect your needs and honor their commitments.

p. 171 Using ["training wheel"] rules to avoid dealing with thorny problmes like jealousy and insecurity can cause us to learn some very bad relationship habits indeed. Even under the best of circumstances, talking about our fears and insecurities is hard. When we talk about our frailties, we become exposed and vulnerable and that is uncomfortable. Relying on rules to deal with these feelings teaches us that we don't have to talk about them, which prevents us from learning the skills we need to find lasting solutions.

p. 175 Anyone should be able to reopen discussions about an agreement at any time. [...] some people set periodic dates in their calendar when they will review their relationship agreements with each other to make sure they're still working and see if anything needs to change.

p. 175 When looking at the structures of your relationship, ask yourself regularly: "Are they honest? Are they necessary? Are they kind? Are they respectful? Are they considerate of others?"

## Chapter 11 -- Hierarchy and primary/secondary poly

- p. 187 Hierarchy can seem like a way to protect ourselves from risk by creating an agreement that our partner will always consider us more important than anyone else. [But.]

- p. 187 Outside of polyamory, the hierarchical model can sometimes work fine. The world of swinging is much larger than the poly world, and emotionally monogamous, hierarchical couples tend to dominate there.

## Chapter 12 -- Veto arrangements

- p. 214 Many people who don't have a formally negotiated veto arrangement come up with ways to veto their partners' relationships anyway. [Line-item veto; force of drama]

- p. 216 We've known a few people who have been in relationships with monogamously inclined partners who agreed to a polyamorous relationship, but only after they "felt secure in the relationship." That turned out to be... never. [...] This idea of "poly readiness" can become a pocket veto if it does not include a clear statute of limitations.

## Chapter 14 -- Practical poly agreements

- p. 234 Effective relationship strategies take work. They are things that meet people's needs. And meeting these needs involves asking why people are doing whatever you wish they wouldn't do. What need does their behavior meet? What function does it serve? Is there something else, something that might be less threatening, that could meet the same need? How invested is the person in doing that particular thing, and why?

- p. 235 Creating such strategies also involves looking at some scary things inside yourself. Why is it not okay with you if that person does that thing? Are the problems you see really problems? Is passing a rule actually an attempt to shift responsibility for your own emotions onto someone else? Does the person doing the thing reasonably have a right to do it? How much does it really affect others, and in what way? Are you just rying to avoid discomfort? If so, is your discomfort more imortant than someone else's choices?

- p. 235 From there, you can work on finding the park bench. What might help everyone get their needs met? If something makes you uncomfortable, how can the person do it and still support you?

- p. 236 Rules that seek to dictate the structure of a relationship that is yet to exist [...] are attempts to map a country you have not yet seen. These types of rules [...] are most often created by people with little experience in polyamorous relationships. Often they attempt to impose order on something that seems mysterious and dangerous. Psychologists have discovered that we are remarkably poor at predicting how we will respond to novel situations. We want certainty; we don't want to get too far from familiar land. But we cannot explore the ocean if we're unwilling to lose sight of the shore. Trying to retain the certainty and order of monogamy against the apparent scary disorder of polyamory usually ends up creating failures in both.

- p. 236 Avoiding discomfort isn't really the same thing as creating happiness; real happiness is often on the other side of our comfort zone. 

- p. 237 Healthy agreements are thos that encourage moving in the direction of greatest courage. [...] The agreements that work most consistently are those that are rooted in compassion, encourage mutual respect and empowerment, leave it to our partners' judgment how to implement them, and have input from -- and apply equally to -- everyone affected by them. These include principles like the following: Treat all others with kindness. Don't try to force relationships to be something they are not. Don't try to impose yourself on other people. Understand when things are Not About You. Understand that just because you feel bad, it doesn't necessarily mean someone else did something wrong. Know that your feelings sometimes lie to you. Own your own mess. Favor trust over rules.

## Chapter 15 -- How poly relationships are different

- p. 261 A particularly insidious pattern can set in when the hormonal cocktail begins to wear off. A person who doesn't understand what's happening may become convinced that the relationship is no longer interesting and was probably a mistake from the start, and they start casting around for a new relationship, which they pursue with zeal until that NRE too wears off. In monogamous culture this takes the form of short-term serial relationships. In polyamory, this pattern can present as a series of ongoing relationships that begin explosively and then wither from neglect. In either case, the chemical high of NRE is mistaken for love, and the sufferer seeks the next new hit like an addict.

## Chapter 16 -- In the middle

- p. 284 She began to feel like an automaton, numbly moving from one commitment to the next, with little room [...] for personal choice and zero room for spontaneity or self-care [...] "tyranny of the calendar".

## Chapter 18 -- Mono/poly relationships

- p. 314 Each [the mono person and the poly person] *says* they accept the other's nature. The monogamous person may even agree to an open relationship in theory -- just not yet, not until the relationship is stable and feels secure. And the poly person gives her that time. And more time. And whenever they talk about opening the relationship, there's some reason not to. 

- p. 317 If you are the poly partner of a monogamous person, you have some work to do. What compromises can you make, while still conducting your other relationships with integrity? How can you set boundaries that create a safe space for your monogamous partner, but not at the expense of your other partners? This balancing act requires flexibility, adaptability, self-knowledge, and compassion.

- p. 322 Mono/poly relationships require special commitment to trust and communication. Being willing to take a leap of faith tha tyour partner is dedicated to your relationship, even if you don't understand your partner's motivations, becomes especially important. On the other side, as the poly person, when opportunities to build trust arise, you really have to behave with integrity. If you've made promises to your monogamous partner, keep them. Even if you don't understand why they want them. If they create real problems, don't break them, renegotiate thtem. Cultivate trust by demonstrating that you are worthy of trust.

- p. 322 If you see polyamory as a problem to be worked around, you're less likely to be happy than if you find a way to make it benefit, you, too.

- p. 326 The monogamous person needs to have [poly-friendly] people with whom to talk and process her emotions.

## Chapter 25 -- The rest of the world

- p. 437 When we talk to people who are closeted, the most common concerns we hear about being out are [...] fear of being seen as "weird" or "strange" (or worse, as a victim)
