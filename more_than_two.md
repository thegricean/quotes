# More Than Two -- A practical guide to ethical polyamory (Franklin Veaux and Eve Rickert

## Chapter 2 -- Many forms of love

- p. 31 Is there a "right" number of partners to have to be poly? No. Is there a "right" number for *you* to have? Maybe. There is certainly some maximum. There is a saying among poly people: "Love is infinite; time and attention are not." [...] Different people have different constraints on the time and attention they can offer, and different relationships require different amounts, so some people can maintain more romantic relationships than others before they become, as the term goes, "polysaturated".

## Chapter 3 -- Ethical polyamory

- p. 39 For each person, the "right" way to do poly is to talk about your needs, fears, and insecurities; to talk about the ways your partner can support you; and to honor your commitments -- without being controlling or placing rules on other people to protect you from your own emotional triggers. Above all else, trust that you don't have to control your partner, because your partner, given the freedom to do anything, will want to cherish and support you. And always, always, move in the direction of greatest courage, toward the best possible version of yourself.

- p. 43 Being able to share, to the best of your ability, who you are in a relationship is critical for that relationship to be consensual. You must give your partner the opportunity to make an informed decision to be in a relationship with you. If you lie or withhold critical information, you remove your partner's ability to consent to be in the relationship. 

- p. 44 It's especially important to communicate things that might be deal-breakers, or might be threatening to your partner's emotional or physical health. [...] You cannot force someone to make the choice you want them to make, and if you lie or withhold information, you deny them the ability to know that there was a choice to be made.

## Chapter 4 -- Tending yourself

- p. 52 Learning to understand and express your needs, learning to take responsibility for your emotions... that's hard work.

- p. 53 Nosce te ipsum. Know thyself. You can't have what you want if you don't know what you want. You can't build a relationship that's satisfying without first understanding yourself and your needs. A willingness to question yourself, to challenge yourself, and to explore without fear the hidden parts of you are the best tools to gain self-knowledge. [...] "Your true self can be known only by systematic experimentation, and controlled only by being known." Understanding and programming your mind is your responsibility; if you fail to do this, the world will do it for you.

- p. 55 becoming the kind of person who can live those [poly] ideals is a never-ending process. [...] Understanding where you are *right now* is just as important. That includes understanding whether you are ready to share a partner or to be shared. The problem with being idealists about polyamory is that we risk putting ourselves into situations we're not ready for. If we do that, we risk hurting other people.

- p. 55 Although self-awareness is important, so is self-compassion. We don't look inward so we can pass judgment on all our flaws. We do it so we can be aware of how our behavior is aligning with our values, what effect we're having on other people, how we may be sabotaging ourselves and our relationships. Understand where you are, yes, but also understand that it's ok to be there, at least for now.

## Chapter 5 -- Nurturing your relationships

- p. 80 Flexibility promotes resilience. It helps create relationships that can adapt to the winds of change without breaking. It has a cost, though. Being flexible means being willing to face discomfort, because change is often uncomfortable. [...] There is more to life than avoiding discomfort. Sometimes discomfort is an inevitable part of learning and growth. [...] When avoidance of discomfort comes at the cost of placing controls on other people, we disempower those people.

- p. 83 A lack of boundaries is not the same thing as compassion, nor is letting someone walk all over us, or overlooking poor behavior or mistreatment of others. Real compassion requires strong boundaries, because if we are letting someone take advantage of us, it becomes very hard to be authentically vulnerable to them. Compassion requires a willingness to hold other people accountable for what they *do*, while accepting them for who they *are*.

- p. 83 How do we practice compassion? The cornerstone of compassion is simple, but emotionally difficult to achieve. It means, first and foremost, assuming good intent from others. In other words, looking for the most charitable interpretation of someone else's deepest motives.

- p. 85 The skill of expectation management means [...] recognizing that a desire on my part does not constitute an obligation on your part. And we can never reasonably be upset at anyone for failing to live up to our expectations if we haven't talked about our expectations in the first place.
