## The Eden Project -- In Search of the Magical Other (James Hollis)

- p. 28 "Only when one has suffered the collapse of projections onto the Other, or tracked the symptomatology to its lair, may one begin to recognize that the enemy is within, that the Other is not what he or she may seem, and that one is summoned to a deep personal accounting before one can begin to clear the terrain for true relationship. One does not come to such recognitions easily, without having suffered failure, shame, rage or humiliation. But in such dreary states may be found the beginning of insight into oneself, without which no lasting relationship may be achieved."

- p. 30 "Consider the obvious, then, that we can hardly have a conscious, efficacious relationship with tthe Other when we have a deeply wounded relationship with ourselves. Consider, then, how difficult it is to have any relationship at all. All that I do not know about myself, all of my secret projects for healing myself of the wounds derived from my culture and family of origin, I am now imposing on you. All the complexes I have acquired in my life on this earth, you will have to suffer from me. How could I do that to you, while professing to love you? How can you do that to me, while professing to love me?"

- p. 37 "The other great false idea that drives humankind is the fantasy of the Magical Other, the notion that there is one person out there who is right for us, will make our lives work, a soul-mate who will repair the ravages of our personal history; one who will be there for us, who will read our minds, know what we want and meet those deepest needs; a good parent who will protect us from suffering and, if we are lucky, spare us the perilous journey of individuation. Virtually all popular culture is fueled by this idea and its fallout -- the search for the Magical Other, finding him or her, the dismaying discovery of this Other's humanness, and the renewed search... Listen to the next ten songs on the car radio. Nine of them will be about the hunt for the Magical Other."

- p. 60 "At all moments, in any relationship, the tension of opposites is present. Where there is communion, there is separateness as well. One of the best formulations of this relational paradox was expressed by the Czech poet Rainer Maria Rilke: 'I hold this to be the highest task of a bond between two people: that each should stand guard over the solitude of the other.'"

- p. 62 "But when we recall that relationship which is dominated by need is also burdened by it, that we may infantilize ourselve parentify the Other, and fial to love them as Other, then we realize that neediness must be confronted, and replaced, by consciousness. Thus Rilke worried, 'How am I to withhold my sould / that it not impinge on yours?'"

- p. 70 "The capacity to affirm the Other requires an enlargement of soul to stand up against the fearfulness which is our condition. To love the Other, with all the Others presumed pwoer to hurt us, requires a substantial amplitude of soul, an enlargement of one's sense of self, so that one is not so precariously at risk. This is what Aristotle meant by the 'magnanimous' person, one with a large enough sense of self to not only allow the Other to be Other, but to be open to whatever power, and capacity for wounding us, the Other may have. Until one can risk this kind of soulfulness, one cannot be said to be able to love."

- p. 76 "We must watch for when and where we are most charged, that is, times when complexes most commonly surface. When our affective response is intense and our rationalizations plentiful, we can be sure that complexes are at work."

- p. 78 "We are obliged to reflect, to ask, 'Where in me does this come from? What does it hit in my history? What does it feel like? What hidden source is creating repetitive patterns in my life?' [...] 'I used to have a fantasy that somewhere there was a Big Book of collective wisdom called 'What To Do When'. It contained the prescribed solution to all life's problems.'"

- p. 79 "Taking responsibility for ourselves is the greatest terror of our journey, and the greatest gift we can bring to the Other."

- p. 80 "No one is angrier than someone doing 'the right thing' and secretly wishing for something else. No one becomes more frustrated than the one who washes a mate's laundry at the expense of his or her own. Most commonly, as we lay our primal parental projections on our partners, and find them not carrying the burden as we wish, we grow puzzled, angry, disillusioned. 'Why don't you make me feel good about myself?' we ask, usually unconsciously but sometime straight out. 'Why don't you meet my needs?' There the Other sits, obnoxiously and frustratingly Other, not at all who we had thought him or her to be. In the beginning we loved the otherness of the Other. Now it drives us up the wall. He, or she, must have changed! How easy to feel betrayed, to fall into resentment and the use of power."

- p. 82 "As we tend to avoid what makes us uncomfortable, we are seldom conscious of the way we enacct sundry power ploys. We may sense our partner's shadowy expressions of power and draw back, accede or resist, but seldom are we free to admit our own power stratagems."

- p. 99 "1. Where do my dependencies show up in the relationship?

		2. What am I asking my partner to do for me that I, as a mature adult, need to be doing for myself?
		3. How do I repeatedly constrict myself through my historically conditioned attitudes and behavior patterns?
		4. Am I taking too much responsibility for the emotional well-being of the Other? Am I taking on his or her journey at the expense of my own, and if so, why?
		5. Am I living muy life in such a fashion that I will be happy with the consequences of my choices? If not, when do I plan to start? What fears, alck of permission or old behaviors block me from living my life?
		6. In what ways do I seek to avoid suffering?"

- p. 135 "The radical willingness to let be, rather than control, requires great courage and constitutes the ultimate respect for the Mystery."

- p. 137 "There is a word for that posture in which one stands awash in ambiguity and affirms it, and that word is 'courage'. There is a word for that experience of reverence for the otherness of the Other, and that word is 'love'."

- p. 138 "When I am with you, we stay up all night.
		When you're not here, I can't go to sleep.
		Praise God for these two insomnias!
		And the difference between them.
								-- Rumi"

## Train robbery (Peter Cook and Alan Bennett)

- wrong interpretation of functional relation between constituents of compound nouns:

## Old quotes that were just laying around on my computer


- "Nothing cramps one’s causal powers like not existing." -- Jerry Fodor

- "I love science, and it pains me to think that so many are terrified of the subject or feel that choosing science means you cannot also choose compassion, or the arts, or be awed by nature. Science is not meant to cure us of mystery, but to reinvent and reinvigorate it." -- Robert Sapolsky

- "If throughout your life you abstain from murder, theft, fornication, perjury, blasphemy, and disrespect toward your parents, church, and your king, you are conventionally held to deserve moral admiration even if you have never done a single kind, generous or useful action. This very inadequate notion of virtue is an outcome of taboo morality, and has done untold harm." -- Bertrand Russell

- "...what Heidegger called the hope for authenticity—the hope to be one’s own person rather than merely the creation of one’s education or one’s environment. As Heidegger emphasized, to achieve authenticity in this sense is not necessarily to reject one’s past. It may instead be a matter of reinterpreting that past so as to make it more suitable for one’s own purposes. What matters is to have seen one or more alternatives to the purposes that most people take for granted, and to have chosen among these alternatives--thereby, in some measure, creating yourself. As Harold Bloom has recently reminded us, the point of reading a great many books is to become aware of a great number of alternative purposes, and the point of that is to become an autonomous self." -- Richard Rorty
