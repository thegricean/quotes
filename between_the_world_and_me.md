# Between the World and Me (Ta-Nehisi Coates)

- p. 33 It does not matter that the "intentions" of individual educators were noble. Forget about intentions. What any institution, or its agents, "intend" for you is secondary. [...] Very few Americans will directly proclaim that they are in favor of black people being left to the streets. Buat a very large number of Americans will do all they can to preserve the Dream. No one directly proclaimed that schools were designed to sanctify failure and destruction. But a great number of educators spoke of "personal responsibility" in a country authored and sustained by a criminal irresponsibility. The point of this language of "intention" and "personal responsibility" is broad exoneration. Mistakes were made. Bodies were broken. People were enslaved. We meant well. We tried our best. "Good intention" is a hall pass through history, a sleeping pill that ensures the Dream.

- p. 39 You can no more be black like I am black than I could be black like your grandfather was.

- p. 47 I did not find a coherent tradition marching lockstep, but instead factions, and factions within factions. [...] Had we retained any of our African inheritance? Frazier says it was all destroyed, and this destruction evidences the terribleness of our capturers. Herskovitz says it lives on, and this evidences the resilience of our African spirit.

- p. 55 [..] perhaps being named "black" was just someone's name for being at the bottom, a human turned to object, object turned pariah.

- p. 78 The need to forgive the officer would not have moved me, because even then, in some inchoate form, I knew that Prince was not killed by a single officer so much as he was murdered by his country and all the fears that have marked it from birth.

- p. 83 And no one would be brought to account for this destruction, because my death would not be the fault of any human but the fault of some unfortunate but immutable fact of "race," imposed upon an innocent country by the inscrutable judgment of invisible gods. The earthquake cannot be subpoenaed. The typhoon will not bend under indictment. They sent the killer of Prince Jones back to his work, because he was not a killer at all. He was a force of nature, the helpless agent of our world's physical laws.

- p. 87 I did know that Bin Laden was not the first to bring terror to that section of the city. [...] In the days after [911], I watched the ridiculous pageantry of flags, the machismo of firemen, the overwrought slogans. Damn it all.
