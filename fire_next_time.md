# The Fire next Time (James Baldwin)

- p. 8 The details and symbols of your life have been deliberately constructed to make you believe what white people say about you. Please try to remember that what they believe, as well as what they do and cause you to endure, does not testify to your inferiority but to their inhumanity and fear.

- p. 8 [White people] are, in effect, still trapped in a history which they do not understand; and until they understand it, they cannot be released from it.

- p. 40 \[...\] what was the point of *my* salvation if it did not permit me to behave with love towards others, no matter how they behaved toward me? What others did was their responsibility.

- p. 43 To be sensual, I think, is to respect and rejoice in the force of life, of life itself, and to be *present* in all that one does, from the effort of loving to the breaking of bread. It will be a great day for America, incidentally, when we begin to eat bread again, instead of the blasphemous and tasteless foam rubber that we have substituted for it. And I am not being frivolous now, either. Something very sinister happens to the people of a country when they begin to distrust their own reactions as deeply as they do here, and become as joyless as they have become. It is this individual uncertainty on the part of white American men and women, this inability to renew themselves at the fountain of their own lives, that makes the discussion, let alone elucidation, of any conundrum--that is, any reality--so supremely difficult. The person who distrusts himself has no touchstone for reality--for this touchstone can be only oneself. Such a person interposes between himself and reality nothing less than a labyrinth of attitudes. And these attitudes, furthermore, though the person is usually unaware of it (is unaware of so much!), are historical and public attitudes. They do not relate to the present any more than they relate to the person. Therefore, whatever white people do not know about Negroes reveals, precisely and inexorably, what they do not know about themselves.

- p. 47 It is not too much to say that whoever wishes to become a truly moral human being \[...\] must first divorce himself from all the prohibitions, crimes, and hypocrisies of the Christian church. 

- p. 68-69 In the beginning, \[...\] a Negro just cannot *believe* that white people are treating him as they do; he does not know what he has done to merit it.

- p. 83 It is so simple a fact and one that is so hard, apparently, to grasp: *Whoever debases others is debasing himself*.

- p. 86-87 For hard example, white Americans congratulate themselves on the 1954 Supreme Court decision outlawing segregation in the schools \[...\] Had it been a matter of love or justice, the 1954 decision would surely have occurred sooner; were it not for the realities of power in this difficult era, it might very well not have occurred yet. \[...\] In any event, the sloppy and fatuous nature of American good will can never be relied upon to deal with hard problems. 

- p. 92 One is responsible to life: It is the small beacon in that terrifying darkness from which we come and to which we shall return. One myst negotiate this passage as nobly as possible \[...\]

- p. 95 I use the word "love" here not merely in the personal sense but as a state of being, or a state of grace--not in the infantile American sense of being made happy but in the tough and universal sense of quest and daring and growth.

- p. 98 I do not mean to be sentimental about suffering--enough is certainly as good as a feast--but people who cannot suffer can never grow up, can never discover who they are.
